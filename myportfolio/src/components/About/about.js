            Hello! My name is Josh Padilla.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am 28 years old and currently reside in Phoenix, Arizona. <br />
            <br /> I am a Full-Stack Web Developer, with my specialty being the
            MERN stack. I've been studying software engineering through the
            University of Arizona for the past 6 months and have come to realize
            it as one of my passions. I thoroughly enjoy making computers do
            cool things and giving life to applications and websites. React has
            been my go-to framework for javascript as I find it very powerful
            and fun to code with.
            <br />
            <br />
            Some of my other passions include hiking/backpacking (especially
            with my dog, Kenai), Photography, going to concerts (when there
            isn't a world-wide pandemic), and travelling (also when there isn't
            a world-wide pandemic going on). Check out my socials below to see
            some more of me! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
